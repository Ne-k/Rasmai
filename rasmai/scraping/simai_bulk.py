# Reading the charts one file at a time from maiノーツ takes about an hour, a second a chart, and

# converted to simai in one place, so it is taken the way the chart database is taken: one shallow
# clone, kept as a cache, with the site left to cover whatever the clone does not have.

# Checked before it was trusted: of the charts in the clone that maiノーツ also publishes a note
# count for, every one agrees exactly.
